# Particle Beam Dynamics Predictor

Particle Beam Dynamics Predictor is a machine learning algorithm designed to predict the distribution of particle positions and velocities within a particle beam as it travels through an accelerator. The algorithm combines classical beam physics equations with machine learning techniques to achieve more precise predictions of the beam's behavior during experiments.

## Overview

Predicting the behavior of particle beams in accelerators is a challenging task. Traditional methods provide only a rough estimate of the beam's shape and momentum, discarding potentially valuable information. The Particle Beam Dynamics Predictor addresses this challenge by integrating classical beam physics equations with a neural network model to predict the beam's phase space distribution.

The algorithm uses experimental data from the accelerator, along with our understanding of beam dynamics, to reconstruct the distribution of particle positions and velocities within the beam. This detailed beam information helps scientists perform experiments more reliably, especially as accelerator facilities operate at higher energies and generate more complex beam profiles.

## Algorithm Structure

The algorithm consists of the following key components:

- A neural network model that takes experimental data and classical beam physics equations as inputs and predicts the beam's phase space distribution as output.
- Data preprocessing using MinMaxScaler to normalize the input data.
- Model training using experimental data, physics equations, and corresponding labels.
- Prediction of the beam's distribution based on new experimental data and physics equations.

## Usage

To use the Particle Beam Dynamics Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Instantiate the predictor class.
2. Generate or provide experimental data, classical beam physics equations, and corresponding labels.
3. Train the model using the `train_model` method.
4. Predict the beam's distribution using the `predict_beam_distribution` method.

Please refer to the example usage in the code for a demonstration of these steps.

## Note

This code is a high-level outline and serves as a starting point for building the algorithm. The actual implementation may require additional considerations, such as the choice of neural network architecture, the integration of classical beam physics equations, and the handling of experimental data. The example data used in this code is randomly generated for demonstration purposes and should be replaced with actual experimental data and physics equations in a real-world scenario.
